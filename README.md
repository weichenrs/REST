## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This work is built upon several excellent open-source projects:
- [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) - Comprehensive segmentation toolbox
- [SkySense](https://github.com/Jack-bo1220/SkySense) - Powerful remote sensing foundation model SkySense
- [VMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba) - VMamba implementation

We thank the remote sensing community for providing high-quality datasets and the authors of foundation models for enabling our plug-and-play architecture design.
